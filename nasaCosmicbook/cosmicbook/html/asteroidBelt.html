        <h2>About Asteroid Belt</h2>
        <p>
          The asteroid belt is a region of space between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter 
          where most of the asteroids in our Solar System are found orbiting the Sun. 
          It is roughly 2 to 4 times the Earth-Sun distance, and spans a region about 140 
          million miles across.
          The asteroid belt contains millions of asteroids, which are small, rocky bodies 
          that range in size from a few feet to hundreds of miles across. 
          The largest asteroid in the belt is Ceres, which is about 587 miles (945 km) in diameter. 
          Ceres is so large that it is classified as a dwarf planet.
          The asteroid belt formed in the region between Mars and Jupiter, 
          where the centrifugal force was too strong for material to coalesce into a planet. 
          Instead, the material remained as small, rocky bodies.
          The asteroid belt is a dynamic region of space. The asteroids are constantly colliding 
          with each other, and some of them are ejected from the belt entirely. 
          Some asteroids have also been captured by Jupiter's gravity and become Trojan asteroids, 
          which orbit the Sun in the same or similar orbits as Jupiter.
