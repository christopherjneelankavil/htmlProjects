        <h2>About Mars</h2>
        <p>
          Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet 
          in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars 
          carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the
          "Red Planet" because of the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on its surface. 
          Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface 
          features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys,
          deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.
          Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and second-highest known 
          mountain in the Solar System, and Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons 
          in the Solar System. Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are 
          thought to be captured asteroids.

            <p>
              The largest canyon in the solar system, Valles Marineris is four 
              times deeper than the Grand Canyon and stretches for over 2,000 miles. 
              It's an incredible sight to behold, and I would love to explore its vast 
              chasms and towering cliffs.

            <p>
              The largest volcano in the solar system,
              Olympus Mons is three times the height of Mount Everest. 
              It's a truly awe-inspiring sight, and I would be fascinated to see it up close.

            <p>
              This crater is home to Mount Sharp, a layered mountain
              that holds evidence of Mars' ancient past. I would love to hike to 
              the top of Mount Sharp and see the view from above, and to explore 
              the crater's many other features, such as its riverbed and its dried-up lakes.

              This crater is thought to have once been a lake, 
              and it's where the Perseverance rover is currently searching for signs of 
              ancient life. I would love to see the crater for myself and to learn more about 
              its fascinating history.

              This is the largest impact crater in the solar system. 
              It's a vast and desolate place, but it's also incredibly beautiful. 
              I would love to explore its depths and learn more about its history.

              This region is home to a network of deep canyons and valleys. 
              It's thought to have been formed by volcanic activity, and it's a very geologically 
              active area. I would love to explore this region and learn more about its unique features.
